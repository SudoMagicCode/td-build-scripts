# TD Build Scripts

Operationally, this repo mostly be included in a directory called `scripts` in the root of a repo that's configured to run with github automation.

You can find TOX files that are built with this automation in the [tdm-packages](https://github.com/SudoMagicCode/tdm-packages) repo.
